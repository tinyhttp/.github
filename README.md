# tinyhttp

_**tinyhttp**_ is a modern [Express](https://expressjs.com/)-like web framework written in TypeScript and compiled to native ESM, that uses a bare minimum amount of dependencies trying to avoid legacy hell. It is well-documented and comes with examples and integrations for almost everything.
